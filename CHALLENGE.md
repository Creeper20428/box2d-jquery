#box2d-jquery challenge

hi, welcome to the box2d-jquery challenge. the idea is simple: contribute to box2d-jquery, get one of <strike>15</strike>14 RaspberryPis.

###terms of challenge
ok, below i listed some challenges, which would be cool if sombody would solve them. if 
 
  * you solve one of the challenges
  * and send me a pull request 
  * and come to the fullstackoptimization (sponsor) table 
  * __[during the jquery europe 2013 converence in vienna (22.2 to 23.2.2013)](http://events.jquery.org/2013/eu/)__ 
  * and talk to me [@enzenhofer](http://twitter.com/enzenhofer) about your pull request

and
  * if i still have a RaspberryPi
  * think your pull request is awesome

then
 * you will get a (1) RaspberryPi
 * max 1 per contributor

ok, here is some legal stuff: at no time you get the right to RaspberryPi and at no time you can demand a RaspberryPi. the RaspberryPi challenge is a promotion, not some kind of sallery or something. It's given freely as an "hey you are awesome" guestor, not as part of code for computer exchange.

all pull-requests must be compatible with the zlib license of box2d-jquery and box2dWeb. no strings attached.

if you want to take part in this challenge you have to agree to the terms above. 

##the challenges

 * one 
 * two
 * three

you can open a ticket in githug and ["call dibs"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dibs) on one of the challenges. but hey, if somebody else want to fix (or feature) the same stuff then there is nothing i or anyone else will do about it. it's ok. hey, coding is fun.



##but i have another idea?
contribute, talk to me, if it's the awesomeness of awesomeness and i still have
